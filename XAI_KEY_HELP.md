## Common API Key Issues

If you're experiencing errors, check these common issues:

### Invalid API Key Format

The error `Incorrect API key provided` usually means one of the following issues:

- The API key is expired or invalid
- The API key format is incorrect
- The API key is not being properly submitted

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check for extra text**: Make sure you've copied ONLY the API key, without any extra text like "Bearer" or spaces
2. **Regenerate the key**: If you're still having issues, try generating a new API key in the X.AI console
3. **Verify account status**: Ensure your X.AI account is active and in good standing
4. **Check for spaces**: Ensure there are no extra spaces before or after your API key

## API Key Format

A valid X.AI API key typically:
- Starts with `p-` or similar prefix
- Contains a mix of letters and numbers
- Is approximately 25-40 characters long

Example format (not a real key): `p-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`
